What we wan't to do
We want to create a great eventscript system to manage multiple teamspeak3 instances as simple as possible. Everybody should be able to manage his voiceserver.

It's a work in progress, what does work now?
Currently we have integrated the base system - you can connect to multiple teamspeak instances and add plugins to them. We don't have any useful plugins for now, but feel free to create and commit some!

But where is the benefit?
Every instance has it's own thread - and every plugin, too. So you don't have any waiting time.

There is no documentation :(
This script isn't finished yet. You will need to wait some more weeks until we get all things working.
